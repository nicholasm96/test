This repository contains scripts used for generating the shortlisted CoDeS3D results for the manuscript - Juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated genetic loci exhibit spatially constrained gene regulatory effects (eQTLs) across human tissues and immune cell types. This study combined multiple levels of biological information (3D genome organization [Hi-C] and tissue/cell type-specific eQTL data) to decipher the biological mechanism linking genetic risk to the development of JIA.
